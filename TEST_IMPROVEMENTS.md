# Test Suite Improvements

## Key Insight: Using vs Testing `with_client`

The `with_client` pattern is a core feature of this gem. After review, we found:

1. **Over-testing**: Multiple test files were testing the same `with_client` implementation details (thread safety, restoration, etc.)
2. **Under-using**: Tests weren't demonstrating how users would actually use the pattern

**Decision**: Keep the existing implementation tests but focus new tests on USING the pattern rather than testing it. The pattern is already well-tested in case_test.rb and database_test.rb.

## What Was Done

### 1. Added Test Helper Methods
- `stub_api_request`: DRY helper for stubbing API requests with common patterns
- `create_mock_client`: Simplified mock client creation
- `assert_error_raised`: Better error assertion with message matching

### 2. Refactored Client Tests
- Reduced from 96 lines to 66 lines (31% reduction)
- Made tests more focused on behavior rather than implementation
- Used data-driven approach for error handling tests
- Removed redundant configuration value tests

### 3. Enhanced Configuration Tests
- Added comprehensive validation testing (nil, empty, whitespace)
- Added mutability tests
- Added global configuration tests
- Tests now verify actual error messages

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Well-Tested Areas
- HTTP error handling (all major status codes)
- JSON parsing
- API key and language parameter inclusion
- Configuration validation
- Thread-safe client switching

### Missing Test Coverage
1. **Network errors**: Connection timeouts, DNS failures
2. **Edge cases**: Malformed responses, partial JSON
3. **Concurrency**: Multiple threads using different clients
4. **Large data**: Pagination with many results
5. **Date handling**: Invalid date formats in responses

## Recommendations for Future

1. **Add integration tests** using VCR to record real API interactions
2. **Test error recovery** scenarios (retry logic if added)
3. **Add performance tests** for large result sets
4. **Test configuration changes** during runtime
5. **Add contract tests** to ensure API compatibility

## Benefits Achieved

- **DRY**: Eliminated duplicate stubbing code
- **Readability**: Tests clearly show intent, not implementation
- **Maintainability**: Changes to API structure require fewer test updates
- **Focus**: Tests verify behavior, not internal details
- **Coverage**: Better validation of error messages and edge cases
